# About me
Hello! I am a master's student majoring in mechanical engineering and engineering & technology innovation management. I am passionate about modeling and controlling robotics. I am also enthusiastic about machine learning and data visualization. I have recently started my new position as a research assistant at the DROP Lab of the Robotics Institute, where I am working on enabling and enhancing robot motions to follow user-specified sketches by developing the "Stable Diffeomorphic Diagrammatic Teaching" framework.

During my free time, I enjoy playing soccer. My favorite soccer players are Kaka and Sun Jihai, who is a member of the English Football Hall of Fame. I also frequently go on self-driving tours.

# What I hope to learn
I am curious about the science behind data visualization because my work involves many data visualization tasks, and I am interested in the design of color and shape. Before enrolling in this course, I evaluated the quality of my visualizations based on my instincts. While I received some praise for them, after the first class, I realized that my actual skills are not as strong as I had previously thought.

So, from this course, I hope to learn the criteria that determine whether a data visualization is good or bad and gain some hands-on experience to practice relevant techniques. I also hope that this course can help me feel more relaxed compared to my other engineering courses and enable me to do better in my current research and throughout my entire career.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

## Assignment1:
this page is part of my assignment.

## Assignment2: [Visualizing government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design.md)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
