# About me
Hello! I am a master's student majoring in mechanical engineering and engineering & technology innovation management. I am passionate about modeling and controlling robotics. I am also enthusiastic about machine learning and data visualization. I have recently started my new position as a research assistant at the DROP Lab of the Robotics Institute, where I am working on enabling and enhancing robot motions to follow user-specified sketches by developing the "Stable Diffeomorphic Diagrammatic Teaching" framework.

During my free time, I enjoy playing soccer. My favorite soccer players are Kaka and Sun Jihai, who is a member of the English Football Hall of Fame. I also frequently go on self-driving tours.

# What I hope to learn
I am curious about the science behind data visualization because my work involves many data visualization tasks, and I am interested in the design of color and shape. Before enrolling in this course, I evaluated the quality of my visualizations based on my instincts. While I received some praise for them, after the first class, I realized that my actual skills are not as strong as I had previously thought.

So, from this course, I hope to learn the criteria that determine whether a data visualization is good or bad and gain some hands-on experience to practice relevant techniques. I also hope that this course can help me feel more relaxed compared to my other engineering courses and enable me to do better in my current research and throughout my entire career.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

## Assignment1:
this page is part of my assignment.

## Assignment2: [Visualizing government Debt](visualizing-government-debt.md)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
