# Wireframes / storyboards

I use shorthand to construct my story. In the Part II stage, my goal is to create a preliminary, though not final, version of my presentation. The overall framework is intact, but I am going to enhance data visualization, design, and passages after gathering feedback from interviewers.

# User research 

## Target audience

### who I hope to reach with your story.

I've separated the target audiences into two groups: NBA fans seeking deeper insights into the game, and individuals unfamiliar with the NBA but potential future audiences. For NBA enthusiasts, while they relish watching their favorite teams and players, the intricacies of the game's rules and formulas may elude them as non-professional players. Through this narrative, I aim to provide them with a better understanding of the game, enhancing their overall enjoyment. As for people unfamiliar with the NBA, I'm trying to make the story funny to captivate their interest and offer them an initial glimpse into the world of NBA.

### Representative Individuals
As there can be a wide range of potential target audiences, I plan to interview as many people as possible with diverse backgrounds. My strategy includes interviewing students on campus, neighbors in my community, and strangers on the street.

| Questions | Interview 1 (Male, 24, student, not NBA fan) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
|   1   |1. Your story provides an analytical view of the NBA's evolution over the past decade, focusing on viewership, revenue, playing style, and statistical changes in the game, like the increase in three-point attempts and scoring averages. 2. The message appears to be clear: the NBA has undergone significant changes in both the financial and gameplay aspects, suggesting a shift in strategy and audience engagement. 3. The information seems comprehensive in showcasing trends and data, but it might lack personal stories or testimonials that could provide context to the data, such as how players or fans feel about these changes.               |
|2  |1.The data visualizations are quite clear and effectively show the changes in the NBA's gameplay and financial aspects. However, a viewer might require background knowledge to fully understand some of the implications of the data. 2. The data seems sufficient for illustrating the story of the NBA’s evolution. However, the story could be enhanced by comparing these trends to other sports leagues or by providing insights into the causes of these changes.     |
|3 |  1.The intended audience seems to be those interested in the business and analytical aspects of sports, particularly NBA fans, sports analysts, and possibly those in sports management.
2.I find the evolution of the game and its financial aspects intriguing, especially the shift towards a more perimeter-oriented game. They might also find the contrast between past and present playing styles humorous or surprising.  |
| 4| It would be interesting to discuss the impact of these trends on the sport’s future and how they influence the global perception of the NBA. Additionally, how these trends compare to other professional sports leagues around the world could offer a broader perspective on the evolution of sports in general. |
