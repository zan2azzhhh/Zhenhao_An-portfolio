# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
## Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday
Source: [The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8)

This article explores various effective cheap protein options. 

Original Visualization:

## Step two: critique the data visualization

1. What I find works well and stands out to me
(1) Title. The title clearly tells the audience the content of this chart

(2) Bar Chart. The bar chart is very effective for comparing different categories

2. What I find does not work well and I will do differently
(1) Subtitle. It expresses similar information as the title, so I would delete the subtitle to remove redundancy.

(2) Picture. The pictures on the top of each bar chart refer to the same information as the X-label, and it is unnecessary to put all of them into the chart. So I would delete those pictures.

(3) Color. By default, people may think that the yellow color is more suitable to represent protein than the blue color. Besides, there is only one type of color, making the chart looks less beautiful. So I'd like to use dark yellow and light yellow for those that cost less, and gray for those that are more expensive. In this way, I can highlight the products that are not only cheap but also nutritious

(4) From highest to lowest.

(5) Calorie numbers. Neither the title nor the subtitle are mentioned to introduce the calories of these products. Moreover, the numbers are put in the top of the bar chart, which has already been ranked by the cost. By convention, it is more expected to put the number that represents Y-label into there but not others. So I would simply delete the calorie information, or turn it into a line chart that is at the same place as the bar chart while removing those numbers that are in the bar chart.

(6) Hard to identify the exact Y value. While the chart shows the exact calorie values, the cost value, which is the more important information, is far less explicit than the calorie.  It happens especially when the bar is far from the Y-axis. So I would add 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 light grey line into the chart so that audiences can more easily understand how much each product costs.




4. Primary audiences
I think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience. Because

5. Finally, how successful what this particular tool / scale at evaluating the data visualizations? How does this method compare to the Good Charts method? Is there anything missing?
