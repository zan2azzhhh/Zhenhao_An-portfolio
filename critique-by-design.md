# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
## Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday

This article explores various effective cheap protein options. 

Original Visualization:

## Step two: critique the data visualization

1. What I find works well and stands out to me
   
   (1) Title. The title effectively communicates the content of the chart.

   (2) Bar Chart. The bar chart is very effective for comparing different categories

2. What I find does not work well and I will do differently

   (1) Subtitle. The subtitle conveys similar information as the title. To eliminate redundancy, I would remove the subtitle.
   
   (2) Color. I think yellow may be associated more with protein than blue. Besides, there is only one type of color, making the chart not only look dull but also hard to get to the important point. So I'd like to introduce color gradients (e.g., dark yellow to light yellow for lower-cost items, and gray for higher-cost items) to enhance visualization and to highlight products that are both affordable and nutritious.

   (3) Pictures. The pictures atop each bar chart duplicate information found in the X-label. So I would remove these pictures.
   
   (4) Calorie numbers. Calorie information is not introduced in the title or subtitle, and placing numbers at the top of the bar chart can make the audience feel confused, as they may expect to see the cost value at first glance. So I would remove those numbers while either deleting the calorie information or presenting it in a separate line chart aligned with the bar chart.
   
   (5) It is hard to identify the exact Y value. Identifying the exact Y cost value is not convenient, especially when bars are distant from the Y axis. To improve clarity, I would add light gray lines at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 on the Y-axis, providing a reference for the cost of each product.

4. Primary audiences
I think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience. Because

5. Finally, how successful what this particular tool / scale at evaluating the data visualizations? How does this method compare to the Good Charts method? Is there anything missing?
