# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
## Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday

This article explores various effective cheap protein options. 

Original Visualization:

## Step two: critique the data visualization

1. What I find works well and stands out to me
   
   (1) Title. The title effectively communicates the content of the chart.

   (2) Bar Chart. The bar chart is very effective for comparing different categories

2. What I find does not work well and I will do differently

   (1) Subtitle. The subtitle conveys similar information as the title. To eliminate redundancy, I would remove the subtitle.
   
   (2) Color. I think yellow may be associated more with protein than blue. Besides, there is only one type of color, making the chart not only look dull but also hard to get to the important point. So I'd like to introduce color gradients (e.g., dark yellow to light yellow for lower-cost items, and gray for higher-cost items) to enhance visualization and to highlight products that are both affordable and nutritious.

   (3) Pictures. The pictures atop each bar chart duplicate information found in the X-label. So I would remove these pictures.
   
   (4) Calorie numbers. Calorie information is not introduced in the title or subtitle, and placing numbers at the top of the bar chart can make the audience feel confused, as they may expect to see the cost value at first glance. So I would remove those numbers while either deleting the calorie information or presenting it in a separate line chart aligned with the bar chart.
   
   (5) It is hard to identify the exact Y value. Identifying the exact Y cost value is not convenient, especially when bars are distant from the Y axis. To improve clarity, I would add light gray lines at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 on the Y-axis, providing a reference for the cost of each product.

4. Primary audiences

The primary audience can be health and fitness enthusiasts who are pursuing a healthy lifestyle and may have limited budgets.  
I think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience. Although the design still needs to be improved, it at least lists a number of products in the X-axis that are good cheap protein resources, which aligns with the audience's priorities.

5. 
I find the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile method highly effective for evaluating visualizations, because of its diverse criteria, prompting consideration of various aspects. Comparing to the Good Charts method, which divides criteria into design execution and contextual awareness, the new method delves even deeper, particularly with engagement and intuitiveness criteria, which I would often overlook. I think the Good Charts method fosters thinking from an emotional perspective, while the new method encourages a more logical approach. Following this method, I would introduce yellow and gray color gradients and adopt a more concise layout.
