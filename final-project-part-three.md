# The final data story
[My Shorthand: Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade]([https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/evolving-trends-in-the-nba-over-the-past-decade/index.html#article](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/evolving-trends-in-the-nba-over-the-past-decade/index.html))

# Changes made since Part II

1. Title

I changed the title from "Why have NBA teams significantly improved their scoring abilities over the past decade?" to "Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade."

2. Story Structure and call to action

I shifted the focus from demonstrating results to exploring interesting and surprising aspects for the audience. The story now begins by highlighting four significant changes over the past decade and delving into the potential reasons behind these shifts. This new structure can be more effective in captivating the audience's attention and providing impactful insights.

Next, I summarize these evolving trends to come up with practical suggestions for my audience, helping them both watch games and play basketball more intelligently and effectively in their daily lives. With the help of a "call to action", I hope my story can be impactful for the audience, going beyond just presenting interesting data.   

3. A new element

I identified the increasing trend of teamwork and being all-around among NBA teams as also important. And I integrated it into the story to add depth and substance.

4. New visualization methods

I chose specific teams (Nuggets and Heat) for a more detailed analysis beyond generic average data for all teams. 

Additionally, I use a radar chart to compare modern and traditional centers, providing a visual representation of the evolving trend toward collaborative play. The radar chart can be very helpful in comparing the ability values of different players.

5. Color schemes

I streamlined the color scheme, retaining only red and blue along with minimal yellow to align with the NBA color scheme. Other colors, such as orange, were all eliminated.

6. Copyright

I included a section at the bottom of the work to acknowledge all data sources. And I provide picture credits beneath each image.

## The audience

Based on the feedback from interviewers, it's clear that the primary audience for my story is NBA enthusiasts. Given the NBA background of my story, fans of the league will enjoy reading and comprehending the story very much. For this audience, my story offers a deeper understanding of how the game has transformed, enabling them to understand modern basketball more comprehensively. In turn, this allows them to stay updated on statistical trends and strategic shifts, enhancing their ability to discuss and enjoy NBA games.

Furthermore, I believe it's also crucial for basketball coaches and players to stay informed about the evolving trends for strategic and training purposes. As the NBA represents the pinnacle of professional basketball, adopting these valuable trends can be beneficial for coaches and players at all levels. In the call-to-action section, I've summarized suggestions based on the analyzed data. Coaches can adapt their training methods, and players can refine their skills to let themselves stay competitive. Players can also pay more attention to the development of versatile and adaptable playing styles to effectively improve their skills.


## Final design decisions

### My design decision:

1. Title: Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade.

2. Four trends that audiences may not realize
   (1) Significant improvement in scoring
   (2) More 3-pint attempts
   (3) More rounds of offensive
   (4) More collaborative and all-round

3. Potential reasons behind these trends
   (1) Data-driven methods
   (2) New rules that benefit offensive

4. Call to action
   Be a more all-round player
   Develop the 3-point skill
   Play more aggressively
   Collaborate well with teammates 

5. Conclusion


### What stands out:
1. The number of 2-point attempts (2PA) is decreasing, while field goal attempts (FGA) and 3-point attempts (3PA) are significantly increasing (FGA = 2PA + 3PA). This is contrary to the intuition that 2-point attempts should also increase with the rise in field goal attempts. This truth would surprise audiences, as it goes against conventional expectations, which outstands the importance of 3 points for modern basketball.

2. Comparing the ability values of 3 top "modern" centers and 3 top "traditional" centers, it's worth noting that players like Nikola Jokic, G. Antetokounmpo, and Joel Embiid have shown significant improvement in assists and 3-point shooting, albeit with a slight decrease in defensive metrics. I believe this chart effectively illustrates the evolving expectations for modern centers in the NBA and the kind of game the league aspires to see. The audience will be impressed by these apparent changes which can be more dramatic than they might have expected, and be able to realize how important being all-around is for being a good modern center.

# Final thoughts

I have included many reflections in "changes made since Part 2". Here are summaries of what I put most effort into and some additional thoughts.

1. Initially, in the "Wireframes and storyboards" section of part 2, I felt a bit confused because I believed I had done a thorough analysis of the reasons behind the observed phenomenon and provided effective visualizations. However, after discussions with the professor and TA, I realized that the focus should be more on crafting a story that leaves the audience impressed and surprised and imparts valuable lessons, rather than solely on statistical analysis. Through reconstruction, the new story presents data that goes beyond the audience's expectations and concludes with suggestions for them to learn, aligning with these two primary objectives.

2. I think I have enhanced the quality of my visualizations by paying more attention to some details, refining the color scheme, and exploring different visualization methods. In addition to using Tableau, the Rawgraph website learned last week was also helpful for creating diverse visual elements like the radar chart. I also incorporated data from more sources, based on a suggestion from an interviewer. An interviewer told me that it would take her some time to figure out the meaning of FGA, 2PA, and PPG, so I included explanations for all the professional terms in the paragraphs.

3. In part 2, I limited the amount of text because I thought the speech would be too concise to add more content. However, upon comparing my story with my classmates, I realized that adding more necessary paragraphs would still contribute to a more complete narrative.

4. While attempting to use diverse section types in my Shorthand, I found that the 'text over media' style proved to be more effective and aesthetically pleasing for my story. So I transitioned most sections to the 'text over media' style, resulting in a visually appealing and cohesive story.
