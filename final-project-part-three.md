# The final data story
[My Shorthand: Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/evolving-trends-in-the-nba-over-the-past-decade/index.html#article)

# Changes made since Part II

1. Title

I changed the title from "Why have NBA teams significantly improved their scoring abilities over the past decade?" to "Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade."

2. Story Structure and call to action

I shifted the focus from demonstrating results to exploring interesting and surprising aspects for the audience. The story now begins by highlighting four significant changes over the past decade and delving into the potential reasons behind these shifts. This new structure can be more effective in captivating the audience's attention and providing impactful insights.

Next, I summarize these evolving trends to come up with practical suggestions for my audience, helping them  both watch games and play basketball more intelligently and effectively in their daily lives. With the help of "call to action" I hope my story can be impactful for the audience, going beyond just presenting interesting data.   

3. A new element

I identified the increasing trend of teamwork and being all-around among NBA teams as also important. And I integrated it into the story to add depth and substance.

4. New visualization methods

I chose specific teams (Nuggets and Heat) for a more detailed analysis beyond generic average data for all teams. 

Additionally, I use a radar chart to compare modern and traditional centers, providing a visual representation of the evolving trend toward collaborative play. The radar chart can be very helpful in comparing the ability values of different players.

5. Color schemes

I streamlined the color scheme, retaining only red and blue along with minimal yellow to align with the NBA color scheme. Other colors, such as orange, were all eliminated.

6. Copyright

I included a section at the bottom of the work to acknowledge all data sources. And I provide picture credits beneath each image.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story. Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

Based on the feedbacks of interviewers, there is no doubt that the primary audiences are NBA enthusiasts. As my story is under the NBA background, NBA fans will enjoy reading it and understand what I am saying. For those audiences my story can give them a deeper understanding of how the game has transformed, allowing them to appreciate and analyze modern basketball more comprehensively, so they can stay updated on statistical trends and strategic shifts, and they can enhance their ability to discuss and enjoy NBA games!

Besides, I think it would be also necessary for basketball coaches and players looking to stay informed about the evolving trends in the sport for strategic and training purposes. The NBA is the best professional basketball league in the world, so it would helpful to adopt these valuable trends to themselves. In my call to action part, I have summarized some suggestions to them based on the data I analyzed. So coaches can adapt their training methods and players refine their skills to stay competitive, and players can pay more attentions to the development of those more versatile and adaptable playing styles to effectively improve their skills.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

### My design decision:

1. Title: Evolving Trends in the NBA over the Past Decade.

2. Four trends that audiences may not realize
   (1) Significant improvement in scoring
   (2) More 3-pint attempts
   (3) More rounds of offensive
   (4) More collaborative and all-round

3. Potential reasons behind these trends
   (1) Data-driven methods
   (2) New rules that benefit offensive

4. Call to action
   Be a more all-round player
   Develop the 3-point skill
   Play more aggressively
   Collaborate well with teammates 

5. Conclusion


### What stands out to me:
1. 2-point attempts(2PA) are decreasing while field goals attempts(FGA) and 3-point attempts(3PA) are significantly increasing(FGA = 2PA + 3PA). This is quite converse to the intuition that 2-point attempts should also increase as the field goal attempts have increased so many. So this truth would make audiences feel very superised. 

2. When comparing the ability values of top modern centers and top traditional centers, it would be impressed to notice that either Nikola Jokic, G. Antetokounmpo and Joel Embild has shown their significant improvement in Assists and 3-points, while a little decrease in defense. This chart effectively shows what the NBA league is expecting the modern centers to do and what kind of game the league is hoping for. The audience will also be impressed by these apparent changes that can be more dramatic than they expect.
