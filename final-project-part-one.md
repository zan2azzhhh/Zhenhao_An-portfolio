# Why have NBA teams significantly improved their scoring over the past few decades?

# Outline
 
Over the past 10 years, the scores NBA teams got have apparently improved. In the 2022â€“23 season, the average points per game(PPG) even reaches 114.2 points, which is the highest mark in history. I believe that there is really a lot to be analyzed so that we can have a better understanding of the latest basketball trends and better enjoy watching the games. So in my final project, I am going to take a look at some statistical data, and find the correlation between the points and its independent variables. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
