# Why have NBA teams significantly improved their scoring over the past few decades?

# Outline

## Overview
Over the past 10 years, the scores NBA teams got have apparently improved. In the 2022â€“23 season, the average points per game(PPG) even reaches 114.2 points, which is the highest mark in history. I believe that there is really a lot to be analyzed so that we can have a better understanding of the latest basketball trends and better enjoy watching the games. So in my final project, I am going to take a look at some statistical data, and find the correlation between the points and its independent variables. 

## Project Structure
### 1. Overview
   
   (1) PPG of the whole league by year from 2013 to 2023

   (2) PPG of Warriors by year from 2013 to 2023

   (3) PPG by team in season 2022-2023 and 2015-2016
   
### 2. Factors that contribute to the scoring increase

   (1) 3-point shot and perimeter shot data from 2013 to 2023

   (2) number of rounds from 2013 to 2023
   
   (3) hit rate of 2-point and 3-point from 2013 to 2023
   
   (4) number of fouls from 2013 to 2023

### 3. Reasons behind this phenomenon

   (1) development of big data and roles of data analyst
   
   (2) Match rules and referees
   
   (3) Characteristics of players

### 4. Influences this phenomenon may cause

   (1) Global market and Revenue
   
   (2) Audience rating
