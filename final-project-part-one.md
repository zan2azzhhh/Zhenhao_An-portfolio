# Why have NBA teams significantly improved their scoring over the past few decades?

# Outline

## Overview
Over the past decade, NBA teams have shown a significant improvement in scoring. In the 2022â€“23 season, the average points per game (PPG) reached a historic high of 114.2 points. To gain a deeper understanding of the evolving trends in basketball, this final project aims to analyze statistical data and identify correlations between points and independent variables.

## Project Structure

### 1. Overview
(1) PPG of the entire league from 2013 to 2023

(2) PPG of the Warriors from 2013 to 2023

(3) PPG by team in the 2022-2023 and 2015-2016 seasons

### 2. Factors Contributing to Scoring Increase
(1) 3-point and perimeter shot data from 2013 to 2023

(2) Number of rounds from 2013 to 2023

(3) Hit rate of 2-point and 3-point shots from 2013 to 2023

(4) Number of fouls from 2013 to 2023

### 3. Reasons behind this Phenomenon
(1) Development of big data and the role of data analysts

(2) Match rules and the influence of referees

(3) Characteristics of players

### 4. Influences of this Phenomenon
(1) Global market and revenue

(2) Audience ratings
